# Wine Detector Using OpenVINO

## Introduction

This is a tutorial on how to use OpenVINO if you have an object detection model. The particular tutorial detects different kinds of wine. Feel free to flip through the Jupyter Notebooks in order to understand how OpenVINO's Python API works. 

## Two Tutorials

### Simple object detection

Contains a brief example of how to set up a network, load it into a plugin, and run inference.

### Real-time object detection

Contains a slightly more complicated example, but puts the pieces together from the simple object detection module in order to detect different kinds of wine from a webcam.
